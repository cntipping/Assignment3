# Time Complexities
Search: O(log n)
Insertion: O(log n)
Combined: 2(log n)
For data set of 1000: 2(log 1000) = 20 (roughly)

In the case of big O, constants are dropped. In this case, 2 would be dropped giving the time complexity of O(log n)

# Balance Maintenance
For Red-Black BSTs, they maintain balance by using the idea that every path from a given node should have the same number of black nodes through rotations and recoloring. In the "RedBlackBST.java" file, I included which operation is used for specific red-black BST violations.
